abstract = {To represent atmospheric data spectrally in three indices (zonal wavenumber, and meridional and vertical modal indices), we propose to use three-dimensional normal mode functions (NMF's) to express the wind and mass fields simultaneously. The NMF's are constructed from the eigensolutions of a global primitive equation model and they are orthogonal functions. The vertical parts are obtained from the solutions of the vertical structure equation with the equivalent height as the eigenvalue. The vertical modal index is associated with a different value of the equivalent height. The horizontal parts of NMF's are Hough harmonics with zonal wavenumber and meridional modal index as two-dimensional scalings. The expansion of global data in terms of NMF's permits the partition of energy into two distinct kinds of motions-gravity-inertia modes and rotational modes of Rossby/Haurwitz type. Both kinds of motion are also partitioned into different vertical modes. Results of the spectral distribution of atmospheric energy, obtained by expanding in the NMF's hemispherical data of the National Meteorological Center, are presented. Information obtained will be useful to select proper horizontal and vertical computational resolutions for representation of atmospheric data.},

abstract = {Abstract An energetics formulation is here introduced that enables an explicit evaluation for the conversion rates between available potential energy and kinetic energy, the nonlinear interactions of both energy forms, and their generation and dissipation rates, in both the zonal wavenumber and vertical mode domains. The conversion rates between available potential energy and kinetic energy are further decomposed into the contributions by the rotational (Rossby) and divergent (gravity) components of the circulation field. The computed energy terms allow one to formulate a detailed energy cycle describing the flow of energy among the zonal mean and eddy components, and also among the barotropic and baroclinic components. This new energetics formulation is a development of the 3D normal-mode energetics scheme. The new formulation is applied on an assessment of the energetics of winter (December?February) circulation in the 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40), the 25-yr Japan Meteorological Agency Reanalysis (JRA-25), and the NCEP?Department of Energy Reanalysis 2 (NCEP-R2) datasets.},

@article{Warn1986a,
abstract = {Statistical mechanical equilibria of the shallow water equations, valid in the limit of weak flow, are found to imply that quasi-geostrophic flow is unstable in the statistical mechanical limit. In equilibrium, most of the energy ends up in short-scale gravity-inertial waves implying an energy transfer to short scales during relaxation, regardless of the nature of the initial state. The situation is therefore quite unlike that described by the quasi-geostrophic version of the equations in which energy flow to short scales is prohibited. The transfer occurs via the divergent part of the flow which, in turn, appears to draw upon the energy of the large scale rotational modes. Following Sadourny, it is conjectured that this mechanism persists in forced-dissipative flows at large Reynolds numbers, leading to a weak direct energy cascade.

abstract = {Numerical land surface models (LSMs) are abundant and in many cases highly sophisticated, yet their output has not converged towards a consensus depiction of reality. Addressing this matter is complicated by the huge number of possible combinations of input land characteristics, forcings, and physics packages available. The Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) and its sister project the Land Information System (LIS) have made it straightforward to test a variety of configurations with multiple LSMs. In order to compare the impacts of the choice of LSM, land cover, soil, and elevation information, and precipitation and downward radiation forcing datasets on simulated evapotranspiration, sensible heat flux, and top layer soil moisture, a set of experiments was designed which made use of high quality, physically coherent, 1-year datasets from four reference sites of the Coordinated Enhanced Observing Period (CEOP) initiative. As in previous studies, it was shown that the LSM itself is generally the most important factor governing output. Beyond that, evapotranspiration seems to be most sensitive to precipitation, land cover, and radiation (in that order); sensible heat flux is most sensitive to radiation, precipitation, and land cover; and soil moisture is most sensitive to precipitation, soil, and land cover. Various seasonal and model specific dependencies and other caveats are discussed. Output fields were also compared with observations in order to test whether the LSMs are capable of simulating an observed reality given a plausible set of inputs. In general, that potential was fair for evapotranspiration, good for sensible heat flux but problematic given its strong sensitivity to the inputs, and poor for soil moisture. The results emphasize that improving the LSMs themselves, and not just the inputs, will be essential if we hope to model land surface water and energy processes accurately. {\textcopyright} 2007, Meteorological Society of Japan.},

abstract = {The paper presents a description of idealized, balanced initial conditions for dry 3D channel models with either the hydrostatic or non-hydrostatic shallow-atmosphere equation set. Both the analytical expressions for an f- and $\beta$-plane configuration are provided and possible variations are discussed. The initialization with an overlaid perturbation is then used for baroclinic instability studies which can either serve as a test case for the numerical discretization or for physical science investigations such as the impact of the Coriolis parameter on the evolution of baroclinic waves. Example results for two channel models are presented which are MCore and the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. The simulations show that the evolution of the baroclinic wave on the $\beta$-plane is more unstable than the corresponding f-plane configuration, experiencing a faster linear growth rate of the most unstable wave mode, a shorter most unstable wavelength, a narrower meridional width, and an earlier breaking of the baroclinic wave. A theoretical analysis based on linearized quasi-geostrophic (QG) theory sheds light on these findings. It is shown that the simulated baroclinic instability waves on both the f- and $\beta$-plane closely match the predicted wavelength, shape and linear growth rate obtained from the QG theory which validates the model results.},

abstract = {Multiply nested mesoscale numerical simulations with horizontal resolution up to 3.3 km are performed to study the generation of mesoscale gravity waves during the life cycle of idealized baroclinic jet - front systems. Long-lived vertically propagating mesoscale gravity waves with horizontal wavelengths similar to100 - 200 km are simulated originating from the exit region of the upper-tropospheric jet streak, in a manner consistent with past observational studies. The residual of the nonlinear balance equation is found to be a useful index in diagnosing flow imbalance and predicting wave generation. The imbalance diagnosis and model simulations suggest that balance adjustment, as a generalization of geostrophic adjustment, is likely responsible for generating these mesoscale gravity waves. It is hypothesized that, through balance adjustment, the continuous generation of flow imbalance from the developing baroclinic wave will lead to the continuous radiation of gravity waves.},

abstract = {We present numerical simulations of stably stratified, vortically forced turbulence at a wide range of Froude numbers. Large-scale vortical forcing was chosen to represent geophysical vortices which break down at small scales where Coriolis effects are weak. The resulting vortical energy spectra are much steeper in the horizontal direction and shallower in the vertical than typical observations in the atmosphere and ocean, as noted in previous studies. We interpret these spectra in terms of the vertical decoupling which emerges in the strongly stratified limit. We show that this decoupling breaks down at a vertical scale of U/N, where N is the Brunt-Vaisala frequency and U is a characteristic horizontal velocity, confirming previous scaling arguments. The transfer of vortical energy to wave energy is most efficient at this vertical scale; vertical spectra of wave energy are correspondingly peaked at small scales, as observed in past work. The equilibrium statistical mechanics of the inviscid unforced truncated problem qualitatively predicts the nature of the forced-dissipative solutions, and confirms the lack of an inverse cascade of vortical energy},

Spectral slopes are close to −5/3 in the range 2.6 to 300–400 km and are independent of latitude, season and location in the troposphere or stratosphere. At larger scales, spectral slopes steepen considerably and approach −3. It is found that spectral amplitudes of wind and temperature have log-normal frequency distributions Spectral amplitudes in the range 2.6 to 400 km vary somewhat with latitude, season and location in the troposphere or stratosphere. Temperature spectral magnitude varies more than velocity spectral magnitude, and is largest in the stratosphere and winter troposphere and smallest in the tropical troposphere.

abstract = {The atmospheric mesoscale kinetic energy spectrum is investigated through numerical simulations of an idealized baroclinic wave life cycle, from linear instability to mature nonlinear evolution and with high horizontal and vertical resolution (Delta x approximate to 10 km and Delta z approximate to 60 m). The spontaneous excitation of inertia-gravity waves yields a shallowing of the mesoscale spectrum with respect to the large scales, in qualitative agreement with observations. However, this shallowing is restricted to the lower stratosphere and does not occur in the upper troposphere. At both levels, the mesoscale divergent kinetic energy spectrum-a proxy for the inertia-gravity wave energy spectrum-resembles a -5/3 power law in the mature stage. Divergent kinetic energy dominates the lower stratospheric mesoscale spectrum, accounting for its shallowing. Rotational kinetic energy, by contrast, dominates the upper tropospheric spectrum and no shallowing of the full spectrum is observed. By analyzing the tendency equation for the kinetic energy spectrum, it is shown that the lower stratospheric spectrum is not governed solely by a downscale energy cascade; rather, it is influenced by the vertical pressure flux divergence associated with vertically propagating inertia-gravity waves.},

abstract = {Multiply nested mesoscale numerical simulations with horizontal resolution up to 3.3 km are performed to study the generation of mesoscale gravity waves during the life cycle of idealized baroclinic jet - front systems. Long-lived vertically propagating mesoscale gravity waves with horizontal wavelengths similar to100 - 200 km are simulated originating from the exit region of the upper-tropospheric jet streak, in a manner consistent with past observational studies. The residual of the nonlinear balance equation is found to be a useful index in diagnosing flow imbalance and predicting wave generation. The imbalance diagnosis and model simulations suggest that balance adjustment, as a generalization of geostrophic adjustment, is likely responsible for generating these mesoscale gravity waves. It is hypothesized that, through balance adjustment, the continuous generation of flow imbalance from the developing baroclinic wave will lead to the continuous radiation of gravity waves.},

abstract = {A diagnostic energetics scheme is developed in order to investigate the energy flows among three-dimensional normal modes (Hough modes in horizontal) in the atmosphere. This scheme is applied to the GFDL version of the FGGE level IIIb data during the winter from December 1978 to February 1979. The resultant energy flow is summarized as follows: available potential energy generated at zonal baroclinic modes (especially at the vertical mode m=4) is directly converted into kinetic energy of the planetary scale barotropic mode. Kinetic energy of the cyclone scale baroclinic mode is transformed into zonal and eddy kinetic energies of the barotropic mode. Parameterizing the horizontal scale of waves by their eigenfrequencies, we find for vertically trapped modes, the kinetic energy spectrum follows approximately the 3 power of the frequency. However, for the propagative Rossby modes, the spectrum obeys the -5/3 power law and merges continuously with the spectrum of the gravity modes. It is concluded from the results that the energy spectrum depends on the vertical propagation properties; the energy spectrum of the propagative Rossby waves is similar to that of gravity waves in the frequency domain. The trapped and the critical modes gain their energy through the interactions mentioned above, whereas we find the propagative modes lose a part of energy through nonlinear mode-mode interactions.},

abstract = {Abstract Rotating stratified turbulence is examined both numerically and analytically, guided by energy and potential enstrophy conservation as well as resonant interaction theory, in order to investigate the cascade properties of rotational and wave modes at Froude numbers of order one or below, over a range of Rossby numbers. As Ro → 0, rotational modes are only weakly coupled to wave modes, and there are only weak rotational wave energy exchanges when initial conditions are random. A catalytic interaction involving two waves and a rotational mode, leaving the rotational mode unchanged, then provides the mechanism for geostrophic adjustment via a downscale cascade of wave energy. When simulations are initially balanced, gravity modes act to damp large-scale rotational modes through a transfer into intermediate-scale gravity modes and a subsequent downscale wave cascade involving the catalytic interaction. At larger Ro transfer from rotational to wave modes is important at any Froude number, and geostrop...},

abstract = {Considerable attention has recently been focused on the distribution of atmospheric kinetic energy over the range of scales often referred to as the mesoscale. Despite the importance of the mesoscale range of wavelengths (101–103 km) for dynamical analyses and for numerical weather prediction, there have been few measurements of the kinetic energy spectrum over this range. Here, we report the results of a new determination of the kinetic energy spectrum of winds near the tropopause level for the wavelength range 2.6–104 km. This spectrum is based on wind measurements made on board airliners in routine commerical service. We find that the spectrum obeys a −5/3 power law dependence on wavenumber over the wavelength range {\~{}}2.6–300 km and a −3 power law over the range 1,000–3,000 km. The spectral magnitudes of the zonal and meridional winds are very similar, especially over the −5/3 region.},

@article{Asselin2016,
abstract = {Under quasigeostrophic (QG) dynamics, the presence of a sharp transition in the stratification profile leads to the formation of comparably sharp vertical gradients of buoyancy. When the QG potential vorticity is assumed to be confined to the jump region, as in surface quasigeostrophy (SQG), the sharp gradients are present initially in the buoyancy field. If smoothly varying initial conditions are considered instead, jump-scale features nevertheless emerge after a few turnover times. Inspection of the omega equation reveals that vertical velocity is vertically smoother than buoyancy. As such, the vertical velocity cannot compensate for the sharpness of the stratification jump in the buoyancy equation. Consequently, buoyancy evolves differently above and below the model tropopause, quickly generating sharp vertical gradients. This is confirmed by numerical simulations. The introduction of this small scale, h, characterizing the tropopause implies a larger Froude number, thereby undermining the validity of the quasigeostrophic approximation. For fixed h, scale analysis gives a characteristic horizontal velocity, U, above which not only does QG break down, but statically unstable conditions also develop. Using typical atmospheric values for the Brunt-V{\"{a}}is{\"{a}}l{\"{a}} frequency, N = 0.01 s−1, and the jump width, h = 100 m, we argue that U must be less than about 1 ms−1 for static stability to hold (and smaller still for quasigeostrophy to be formally valid). Therefore, quasigeostrophic dynamics are consistent only with very weak near-tropopause flows and thus can hardly account for the observed wind profiles (e.g., the Nastrom and Gage spectral break). We also find that initially smooth flows exhibit secondary roll-up of filaments and shallow slopes near the model tropopause, reminiscent of SQG dynamics. These flows, however, are not SQG-like in the sense they have non-vanishing vertical velocities at the tropopause.},
